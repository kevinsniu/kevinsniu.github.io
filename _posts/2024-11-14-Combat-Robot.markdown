description: 3lb Combat Robot sponsored by Georgia Tech's RoboJackets. This robot has an in-built hub motor for the drum spinner and four-wheel drive for maximum maneuverability. The hub motor uses a 2836 Brushless Motor (1500kV) from HOBBYWING paired with a Luminer 51A ESC. The drivetrain is powered by the Repeat Robotics Drive Max V2 motor and gearbox combo. Robot control is achieved through the Flysky FS2A over PWM. The entire robot is powered by a 3S (11.1 V) 930mAh LiPo battery. The goal of this project is to explore brushless motor integration with custom printed and machined interfaces. Previously, my project only used brushed or stepper motors, so this was a convenient avenue to experiment on someone else's dime. There are two main uses of motors in this project. First, the drivetrain uses two 2100kv 2006 brushless motors mated to 27:1 planetary gearboxes. With the drivetrain, I designed custom wheels with a built-in S3M pulley. The pulleys on each wheel are belted together, enabling all four wheels to be driven. The second use of brushless motors is in the "weapon". First, I did a spinup test with the weapon motor and speed controller to make sure it worked before I gruesomely dissasembled it. Next, I started working on the CAD of the drum that interfaces with the magnet ring. The end goal of learning about brushless motors is to integrate a more power-dense and efficient locomotion system for my other projects.
