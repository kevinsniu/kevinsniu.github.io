description: 3lb Combat Robot sponsored by Georgia Tech's RoboJackets. This robot has an in-built hub motor for the drum spinner and four-wheel drive for maximum maneuverability. The hub motor uses the 2836 Brushless Motor (1500kV) from HOBBYWING paired with a Luminer 51A ESC. The drivetrain is powered by the Repeat Robotics Drive Max V2 motor and gearbox combo. Robot control is achieved through the Flysky FS2A over PWM. The entire robot is powered by a 3S (11.1 V) 930mAh LiPo battery.
